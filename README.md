![alt text](http://ukc.disi.unitn.it/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Cognate_fish.jpg)

It is a large-scale database of cognate pairs: it contains 5.9 million cognates in 338 languages and 38 writing systems. It was automatically constructed from wordnets and dictionaries contained within the UKC resource, as described in our paper.

    abstract = "This paper introduces CogNet, a new, large-scale lexical database that provides cognates -words of common origin and meaning- across languages. The database currently contains 3.1 million cognate pairs across 338 languages using 35 writing systems. The paper also describes the automated method by which cognates were computed from publicly available wordnets, with an accuracy evaluated to 94{\%}. Finally, it presents statistics about the cognate data and some initial insights into it, hinting at a possible future exploitation of the resource by various fields of lingustics.",
